# Trade Signal Generator

**Stage:** Problem Framing & Scoping (Stage 01)

---

## Problem Statement
In algorithmic trading, generating reliable trade signals (e.g., predictions of stock price movements based on momentum or volume patterns) is essential for capturing profitable opportunities, but poor signals lead to inconsistent returns or losses. This project aims to develop a tool to generate a predictive trade signal for a single stock, using historical market data to forecast short-term price direction (up or down) with an associated confidence score. By creating actionable signals, the tool will enable algorithm developers to build more effective trading strategies in dynamic markets.

---

## Stakeholder & User
- **Stakeholder:** The trading firmâ€™s strategy team, responsible for developing high-performing algorithmic trading systems.
- **User:** Algorithm developers at the trading firm, who use the tool during strategy prototyping to generate and test new signals. The tool integrates into their Python-based workflow, providing signals within their existing development environment.

---

## Useful Answer & Decision
- **Type:** Predictive
- **Metric:** Signal confidence score (probability of correct price direction prediction, e.g., 0-1 scale).
- **Artifact:** A generated signal output (e.g., "Buy AAPL with 0.75 confidence") and a report on signal generation logic, enabling developers to incorporate signals into trading algorithms.

---

## Assumptions & Constraints
- **Data Availability:** Public tick-level market data (e.g., Alpaca or Yahoo Finance APIs) is accessible for a single stock (e.g., AAPL).
- **Capacity:** Signal generation is limited to one stock and simple patterns (e.g., momentum) to ensure feasibility.
- **Latency:** Analysis is offline at this stage, using historical tick data to prototype signal generation.
- **Compliance:** All data is publicly available, avoiding proprietary or restricted datasets.

---

## Known Unknowns / Risks
- **Data Quality:** Public tick data may include noise or gaps, affecting signal accuracy. **Mitigation:** Clean data and validate with multiple sources.
- **Market Predictability:** Signals may perform poorly in unpredictable markets (e.g., high volatility). **Mitigation:** Test signals across different market conditions.
- **Overfitting:** Simple models might fit historical data too closely without generalizing. **Mitigation:** Use cross-validation techniques in prototyping.
