    "# Stakeholder Memo: Trade Signal Generator\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem  \n",
    "In algorithmic trading, the absence of reliable, data-driven signals to predict stock movements can lead to missed profit opportunities and increased losses. Generating high-quality predictive signals is essential for building and refining trading strategies that remain competitive in dynamic markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proposed Solution  \n",
    "Develop a lightweight tool to generate predictive trade signals (e.g., *\"Buy if price momentum is positive\"*) for a specific stock such as Apple (AAPL), using freely available market data sources. The tool will produce:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Signal** — e.g., Buy, Sell, or Hold  \n",
    "- **Confidence Score** — e.g., *Buy with 0.75 probability*  \n",
    "\n",
    "These outputs will help algorithm developers quickly prototype, evaluate, and integrate signals into production strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Better Trades** — Capture more profitable opportunities through timely, data-backed signals.  \n",
    "- **Faster Development** — Streamline prototyping and integration for strategy teams.  \n",
    "- **Competitive Edge** — Improve responsiveness to evolving market patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Acquire free historical and live stock data (e.g., from Alpaca, Yahoo Finance, or Alpha Vantage).  \n",
    "2. Build a prototype program to generate and score signals.  \n",
    "3. Produce a concise performance report with signal accuracy, precision, and recall for developer review.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Questions  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Does this focus on predictive signal generation align with current strategic priorities?  \n",
    "- Are there preferred trading patterns (e.g., momentum, mean reversion) or market features (e.g., order book depth, volatility) to prioritize in the initial design?\n",
    "- How will the predictions be made accurate?\n",
    "- What models will be used to achive this? \n",
    "- Can this be done in real time? \n",
    "\n",
