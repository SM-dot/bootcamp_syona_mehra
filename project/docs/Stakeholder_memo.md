# Stakeholder Memo: Trade Signal Generator


## Problem  
In algorithmic trading, the absence of reliable, data-driven signals to predict stock movements can lead to missed profit opportunities and increased losses. Generating high-quality predictive signals is essential for building and refining trading strategies that remain competitive in dynamic markets.

## Proposed Solution  
Develop a lightweight tool to generate predictive trade signals (e.g., *"Buy if price momentum is positive"*) for a specific stock such as Apple (AAPL), using freely available market data sources. The tool will produce:  

- **Signal** — e.g., Buy, Sell, or Hold  
- **Confidence Score** — e.g., *Buy with 0.75 probability*  

These outputs will help algorithm developers quickly prototype, evaluate, and integrate signals into production strategies.



## Benefits  

- **Better Trades** — Capture more profitable opportunities through timely, data-backed signals.  
- **Faster Development** — Streamline prototyping and integration for strategy teams.  
- **Competitive Edge** — Improve responsiveness to evolving market patterns.



## Next Steps  

1. Acquire free historical and live stock data (e.g., from Alpaca, Yahoo Finance, or Alpha Vantage).  
2. Build a prototype program to generate and score signals.  
3. Produce a concise performance report with signal accuracy, precision, and recall for developer review.



## Key Questions  

- Does this focus on predictive signal generation align with current strategic priorities?  
- Are there preferred trading patterns (e.g., momentum, mean reversion) or market features (e.g., order book depth, volatility) to prioritize in the initial design?
- How will the predictions be made accurate?
- What models will be used to achive this? 
- Can this be done in real time?
